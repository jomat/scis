This is a piece of python based on some pysilc sample.
The idea behind it is to create a silc command line client.
The commands are reminiscent of them defined in RFC1459,
but there is one additional command:
SERVER silchost [silcport (default: 706)]
This command sets the silc server to connect to.

Now you can hook the script to your inetd-superserver
(I use xinetd, so I also created a sample for it) and fire your favourite
irc client to it.
Yes, IRC client, not irc client with some patched silc support. All your
client has to do is to send the SERVER command somehow and you will be
proxied to your favourite silc net.
Look at irssi_sample how it works.

To install it to xinet.d, copy the files somewhere and configure them to
your needs:
sudo cp xinetd.conf /etc/xinetd.d/scis
sudo cp scis.py /usr/local/bin/

Hints:
* You need python-silc, on debian: sudo apt-get install python-silc
* This isn't secure at all.
* The above description is how it should be. Reality can be different.

Todo:
* The keys are regenerated every time.... perhaps the user wants to set them somehow
